etch-a-sketch
In this project i will recrate Etch-A-Sketch board.
I will mostly use HTML, CSS, JavaScript to create the board.
This project will have functionality to change the boards from small to medium and big.
Also clear function to remove anything on the board for example if has blue color and etc.
Also have color that you can choose from red, green and blue and eraser button that clears as you move with the mouse.
The Dom event i used are mouseover when user moves his mouse over the board changes color and clicks then user clicks
the button to call the function for example to delete the existed grid and created new grid.
